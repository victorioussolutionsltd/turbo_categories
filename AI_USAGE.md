# Microsoft GitHub Copilot

I used Copilot's suggestions, but also asked the question how the docker-compose.yml from another repository should be integrated, and whether it is good practice to put it in the root folder.
Some questions related to NestJS complaining about unrecognised Logger usage.

# Used phrases:

- can Dockerfile live under apps?
- "pnpm add axios" (in frontend to speed up the process)
- create context api hook and store data from App.tsx there
